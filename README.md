# Gengo API Client

An attempt at writing a client for the [Gengo API](https://developers.gengo.com/v2/api_methods/) in Elixir.

Not meant to eventually be a serious client, more of a simple exploratory project.

## TODOs that I will probably never find the time to implement
- unit tests!
- finishing missing endpoints - e.g. PUT on job/jobs, file quote, etc.
- beautiful documentation
- better error handling
